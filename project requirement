10. Gas Meters
 
A gas meter is a specialized flow meter, used to measure the volume of fuel gases such as natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. Gas meters are used at residential, commercial, and industrial buildings that consume fuel gas supplied by a gas utility. Gases are more difficult to measure than liquids, because measured volumes are highly affected by temperature and pressure. Gas meters measure a defined volume, regardless of the pressurized quantity or quality of the gas flowing through the meter. Temperature, pressure, and heating value compensation must be made to measure actual amount and value of gas moving through a meter.
Several different designs of gas meters are in common use, depending on the volumetric flow rate of gas to be measured, the range of flows anticipated, the type of gas being measured, and other factors.

11. Pressure Gauge
 
Gas pressure gauges are essential instruments in the gas utility industry, used to measure and monitor gas pressure within pipelines and systems. They are crucial for ensuring safe and efficient gas delivery by maintaining pressure within specified limits, detecting leaks, and aiding in system control. 
Key functions and applications:

Sudden drops in pressure, as indicated by the gauge, can signal potential leaks in the system, allowing for timely intervention.
•	System Control:
By monitoring pressure, operators can adjust gas flow and pressure levels as needed to maintain optimal system performance. 

12. Flame Arrestor
 
A flame arrester is a safety device designed to prevent the spread of fire or explosions by stopping the propagation of flames in flammable gas or vapor mixtures. It allows the flow of gases or vapors under normal conditions but extinguishes flames by cooling the hot gases below their ignition temperature. Flame arresters are crucial in various industrial applications to protect equipment and personnel from potential hazards. 
How it works:
•	Flame arresters typically consist of a matrix of small passages or channels. 
•	When a flame front passes through these passages, the heat is dissipated into the arrester material, and the flame is effectively quenched. 
•	This prevents the flame from traveling further and igniting other parts of the system. 
Types of flame arrestors: 
•	Deflagration arresters: Designed to stop flames traveling at subsonic speeds. 
•	Detonation arresters: Designed to withstand flames traveling at supersonic speeds and the resulting pressure waves. 
•	End-of-line arresters: Typically installed at the end of a pipe or vent. 
•	Inline arresters: Installed within a pipeline to protect sections of the system.
